    <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 cups chopped Swiss chard</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional for serving, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed..</li>
    <li>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
</li>
<li>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese.</li>
<li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
